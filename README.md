# Simulation_Mass_on_a_spring (2019)
Analytical and numerical simulation of a mass on a spring with adjustable parameters and nice visualization. Numerical simulation uses highly reliable Runge-Kutta method of 4th degree.

## How to use
Start the Unity application using "Zavazi na pruzine - fyzika.exe"



### Disclaimer
The application isn't perfect, it was my second project, but it can still serve as a very useful experimentation and visualization tool.
* Overdamped analytical solution is incorrect - better to use numerical solving. The application uses analytical solution unless an external force is applied. So you can set the mass to some large value and external force to the smallest and it will be negligible.
